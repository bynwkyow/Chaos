# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
- **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
- **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- **Focusing on what is best** for the overall community
- **Showing respect** for other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **The use of sexualized language or imagery**, and sexual attention or advances
- **Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments**, and personal or political attacks
- **Public or private harassment**
- **Publishing others' private information**, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- **Other conduct** which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include:

- Using an official e-mail address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Representing the project at conferences, meetups, or other events

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[8v0ky0@gmail.com](mailto:8v0ky0@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through speech or behavior that violates the Code of Conduct.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 3. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to the community leaders by emailing [8v0ky0@gmail.com](mailto:8v0ky0@gmail.com).

**All reports will be kept confidential.** In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all involved parties will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first.** If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to contact them and provide them with information.

### What to Include in Your Report

- **Your contact info** (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
- **Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms)** of any individuals involved
- **Description of what happened**, including if you believe the incident is ongoing
- **Description of where it happened**
- **Any additional context** that you believe is relevant
- **Any other information** you believe we should have

### What Happens After You Report

You will receive an email from the community leaders acknowledging receipt within 24 hours (and we will aim for much quicker than that).

The community leaders will meet to review the incident and determine:
- What happened
- Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
- Who the bad actor was
- Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the working groups' immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events, they will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may range from taking no action, to permanent expulsion from the community, depending on the circumstances.

The community leaders will reach out to the original reporter to let them know what actions (if any) we decide to take. We will take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.

Finally, once any immediate safety concerns have been addressed, the working group will post a public report of the incident (keeping details as appropriate for a public audience). The community may choose to communicate this message in other channels as well.

## Appealing

Only permanent resolutions (such as permanent bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision, contact the community leaders at [8v0ky0@gmail.com](mailto:8v0ky0@gmail.com) and they will review the case.
